  summary:
    "DevOps/SRE engineer focused on scaling systems, reducing failure, and cutting cloud cost. 7+ years Linux, 5+ years cloud (AWS-heavy). Migrated 20+ apps to AWS and managed 500+ domains. Strong in Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, and observability.",
  aboutJourney:
    "I started my tech journey with a deep curiosity for how systems work under the hood. What began as tinkering with Linux servers quickly evolved into a passion for building resilient, scalable infrastructure. Over 7+ years, I've gone from managing a single server to architecting distributed systems that process millions of requests. I believe great infrastructure is invisible — it just works, reliably, every time.",
  aboutWork:
    "I specialize in transforming fragile, manual-heavy infrastructure into automated, observable, and highly available systems. Whether it's cutting your AWS bill in half, achieving 5-second failover, or shipping code 80% faster with CI/CD — I bring production-grade reliability to every project.",
  aboutHobbies:
    "Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new open-source tools, contributing to developer communities, and staying current with cloud-native trends. I also enjoy volleyball and spending time outdoors in the beautiful countryside of Rajbari.",
